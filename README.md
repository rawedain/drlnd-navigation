# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, I will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world as part of the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).
.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies:
    - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
    - [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
    - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
    - [UnityAgents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

2. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

3. Open your Jupyter Notebook, open the Navigation.ipynb file, which you can use to explore and reproduce the experiments.
